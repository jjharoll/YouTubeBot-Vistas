YouTubeBot is an easy to use simple python script that makes use of selenium to automate the process of increasing views on your Youtube Videos.

## Requirements

* Any of the python3 versions may work for you, but we highly recommend using python 3.7+
* Web Browser (Chrome or Firefox)
* Drivers for their respective broswsers.
  
  We have included the drivers for the browsers in their respective folders. To get further info about drivers, or have any issues , kindly refer to the README.md files in those folders.

## Installation and Setup

- Make sure you have Python3 installed in your system.
- Then install the necessary libraries and modules by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download the apt Web Drivers (I have already included the drivers, so no need to worry).
- Add the drivers to the path and you are done!!

## Usage
- Add the URL of your YouTube video and hit Submit.
- Add the duration (specify how much time the script should "watch" your video. Format is HH:MM:SS)
- Add the number of times you want to execute the script (mention inf for infinite).
- Finally click on the start button to execute it.
